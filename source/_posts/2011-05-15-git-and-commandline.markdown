<p>If you are a web developer you should be using a version control system. In my opinion the best one is <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Git is very powerful which means it can be a bit intimidating. The payoff is worth the learning curve though. Here are few resources that have helped me learn <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and the Commandline.</p>

<p>Even if you don't use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and instead choose to use something like <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">SVN</a> or <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> you will find it very valuable to learn how to use the commandline. Trust me.</p>

<h2>Commandline Resources</h2>

<p>These videos taught me so much about the commandline. They aren't free but if you really want to learn a lot quickly they are worth every penny.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://peepcode.com/products/meet-the-command-line">Meet the Commandline</a> narrated by <a href="http://5by5.tv/">Dan Benjamin</a> of <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> fame.</li>
<li><a href="https://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line">Advanced Command Line</a> also narrated by <a href="http://5by5.tv/">Dan Benjamin</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Git Resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://progit.org/book/">Pro Git</a>: This was the first thing I read when I started with Git. Great book with a lot of good info. You can buy the paperback or read it online for free.</li>
<li><a href="https://peepcode.com/products/git">Git</a>: Another great <a href="https://peepcode.com/">Peepcode</a> video. I highly recommend this video. Really helped me wrap my head around Git.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html">Git Cheatsheet</a>: An interactive Git cheatsheet. </li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>: Do yourself a favor and just use Github. They make hosting your code so easy. Love them.</li>
<li><a href="http://help.github.com/">GitHub Help</a>: Github also has some great Git resources. Check them out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few other Git resources.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gitcasts.com/">GitCasts : Git Screencasts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gitref.org/">Git Reference</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Git Clients I Recommend</h2>

<ul>
<li>Terminal. Yeah. I prefer the commandline</li>
<li><a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">GitX</a> GitX is the defacto standard client for Mac users. Not very feature rich, but it's simple and fast.</li>
<li><a href="http://gitx.laullon.com/">GitX (L)</a> My current client of choice. Mainly for viewing diffs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.git-tower.com/">Git Tower</a> It's the best GUI client for Git I have ever seen. I don't use it, but I know several developers who swear by it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are comfortable with Git you will wonder why you waited so long to start using it. It's not just a way to version your code, it's a really powerful tool to help you write better code.</p>
