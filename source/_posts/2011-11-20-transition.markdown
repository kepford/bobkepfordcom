I'm very excited to announce that in a few weeks I will be transitioning into a new position as a Web Developer at <a href="http://www.fresno.edu/" title="Fresno Pacific University">Fresno Pacific University</a>. I've known <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lisaalvey">Lisa</a> for some time and I'm super excited about working with her and the rest of the Communications team. In this new position I will be building and managing the public facing web sites and web applications for the University, most of which are Drupal based(Thanks <a href="http://nickgundry.com/" title="Nick">Nick</a>).

Five years ago I started working for <a href="http://statecenter.com/" title="State Center Consortium">State Center Consortium</a> as a part time Webmaster. I've had a few bosses in that time span but Amanda Hopkins has been my boss for the majority of that time. She is an amazing person and leads a great team there, it's been an honor to work with them. It's rare that you can find a place where you can stretch out and try new things, learn new things, and have a real voice that is honored and respected. Gonna miss the folks at SCC but I'm excited about the future and my new role at FPU.
