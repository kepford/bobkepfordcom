This is a talk I gave at <a href="http://2009.drupalcampla.com/">Drupal Camp LA 2009</a> in Irvine at UCI.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kepford/death-to-paper-drupalcampla09">Session Slides</a></strong></p>

<p>See how we replaced a unreliable paper-based approval system within our Community College District. We needed to create an online database for Articulation Agreements between the Colleges in our School District and the High Schools in our area. The goal was to migrate a paper-based review and approval system to an online system using Drupal. Workflow module was the key to this.</p>
