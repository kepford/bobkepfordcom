<hr>
<p>On February 24th 2009 I was privileged with the opportunity to speak in a session at the Educating for Careers Conference. This post is a list of some of the resources I shared in this session titled "How to Set-up Your Own Blog"</p>
<p>I chose to show the attendees how to use <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> to set up their blog. It is important to note that Wordpress is not only a great blogging platform but is also a great CMS (Content Management System). It can be used for a site that is not a blog such as a school or business web site.</p>
<p>I used WordPress for several years before moving over to <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> which is a different CMS. I do not recommend <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> to most people unless they are web designers or developers since it is quite a bit for complex to set-up. <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> is fine for most people that want a blog. I have listed my demo outline and several lists of links to resources I mentioned in my talk.</p>

<h2>WordPress Resources</h2>
<p>Here is a short list of a few <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> resources. A simple Google search will turn up countless more.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress">Getting Started with WordPress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE-RXEp52oo">Getting Started with Wordpress.com Video</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Blogging Services/Software</h2>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> is not the only blogging platform and may not be the best option for you. I have used <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> and it is definitely one of the best. I also love <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr.com</a> which is very easy to use. It is simple and clean. Not as versatile as <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> but very easy to post to. <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> is also a good option that is owned by Google. <a href="http://edublogs.org/">EDUblogs</a> uses <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> software, but is designed for educators.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></li>
<li><a href="http://edublogs.org/">EDUblogs</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Social Networking</h2>
<p>List is another short list of social networks I mentioned in my talk. Using these services is a good way to let people know about your web site.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a></li>
<li><a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Domain Names</h2>
<p>If you get serious about this blogging thing you want to invest in your own domain name. It isn't expensive at all and is fairly straight forward to do. Lately I've been using <a href="http://1and1.com/">1and1.com</a> but there are countless other options. <a href="http://1and1.com/">1and1.com</a> also offer web hosting but I Do Not recommend their hosting service.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://1and1.com/">1and1.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Web Hosting</h2>
<p>While you can host your blog/web site with <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> for free, if you register your own domain and want to customize your site more, you may want to look into using a web host to host your site. I recommend using <a href="http://a2hosting.com/">A2hosting.com</a>. They have excellent support and are very inexpensive. They also offer easy installation of a long list of web applications like WordPress. As with most web hosting companies, they offer domain name registration but it is a better idea to use a domain registrar in case you are not happy with the web host. It is much easier to move your site if you have a separate domain registrar and web host.</p>
