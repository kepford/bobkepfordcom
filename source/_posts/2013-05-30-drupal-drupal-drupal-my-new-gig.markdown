I'm happy to announce that in a few weeks I will begin working with the fine folks at [Mediacurrent](http://www.mediacurrent.com) in the role of Senior Drupal Developer. MediaCurrent helps organizations built websites using Drupal. It's also a distributed company based in Atlanta, Georgia so I will remain in the [Central Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)). I'm very excited about the opportunity to work in growing [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) shop that serves clients like Duke University, Nascar, the Miami Dolphins to name a few. My role there will be to translate client needs into a working Drupal web application that meets the client's needs. If you know me, you know that I am passionate about the web, technology, and Drupal.

While I am excited about this new opportunity I will truly miss my friends and colleagues at [Fresno Pacific](http://fresno.edu). I've had a blast with the awesome crew there at FPU. It's truly an amazing place full of awesome and talented people. I will dearly miss them.
